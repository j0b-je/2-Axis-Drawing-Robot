# 2-Axis-Drawing-Robot
This repository contains the code and 3D models for a 2D delta robot
This project was a school assignment for bachelor mechanical engineering at the Haagse Hogeschool Delft, made during the 4th semester of the second year.
The assignment itself was made to show the students different ways of getting to a given set of coordinates with a 2-axis delta robot. It also showed the limitations of a 9 gram servo, a project requirement.
